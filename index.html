          <h2>Nelson Samayoa</h2>
          <p>Professional software developer since 2010, graduate of Oregon State University.
            My original real passion in life is language learning. I don't mean linguistics specifically, although that
            does of course
            interest me as well. I mean literally learning languages for fun. To most people it's a chore to be avoided
            but for me it's how
            I relax. The feeling of being able to decipher something that only a few hours ago was completely
            meaningless is a feeling I'm probably
            addicted to. Fortunately for me, this natural drive helps me a lot as a software developer because ideally
            every day is a day in which
            I come to understand something that I did not understand when I woke up that morning.</p>
          <p>
            I have to make an effort
            keep myself from having too many hobbies because there are so many things that interest me. This page
            describes some of the main topics that make my life interesting (in addition than family and friends of
            course).

          <p>
            I started learning C# in 2009 and in 2010 I started my internship at Intel in Oregon.
            It was at Intel that I fell for C# and the .Net way of doing things. When I started my internship
            most of my experience had been in C++, which is common for Computer Science students at Oregon's
            universities.
            C# and .Net just felt more <i>enterprise</i>, in a good way. It just felt like the right language and
            tooling to use when you had to make software that absolutely worked and was maintainable. This sentiment
            has gotten strong over the years and as I complete a decade as a C# developer I'm grateful to me from
            the past for having chosen such a great language as my primary programming language. I feel like I've grown
            alongside .Net and now .Net Core. I was there when WinForms was common, and WPF was still new. When WFC was
            still king among enterprise and MVC was a new way of architecting a web app. I'll also still be there as
            .Net Core
            grows and matures to be an even better framework than it already is. Enough emotion, let's talk tech...
          </p>
          <h2>Web API</h2>
          <p>

            There's a lot to love about building API's in .Net, but among my favorites is the magic that happens at the
            controller.
            It's easy to take the ApiController base class for granted, but if you've ever made a NodeJS API you'll know
            that .Net
            takes care of a lot of tedium for you. I love that all you have to do is add an attribute to your controller
            method
            (HttpGet, HttpPost, HttpDelete, HttpPut, etc...) and the framework takes care of routing for you. You can,
            of course,
            customize the routing by supplying parameters into the previously mentioned attributes, but that's optional.
            It's so nice
            to then add Swagger on top to give your API a user-friendly interface, and so much of that is magical as
            well. I love
            opening up the startup.cs and whatever other startup/config files are in the API to peek at the what Auth
            the API uses, what
            dependency injection framework it's using, is CORS enabled, is it strict on JWT's, is it using JWT's at all?
            All the cool stuff
            is in the startup.cs and its friend files.
          </p>
          <h2>Entity Framework (and Linq)</h2>
          <p>
            Back in the my dark ages where I was building personal websites with PHP on the backend (very very long time ago),
            I was getting and writing to and from my MySql databases uses hard-coded statements as strings right in my PHP code.
            I'm glad I went through that because it helps me appreciate Entity Framework, and ORMs in general I suppose.
            My first experience working with databases professionally was at my time at Dell Software. I'd just finished my 18 month
            internship at Intel and was still very green. My team at Dell was awesome and introduced me to so many aspects of C# and .Net.
            Entity and Linq are simply amazing and work so beautifully together. I love that I can setup Entity using the onModelCreating method
            to rename columns to abstract from myself to sometimes really bad names people give to columns. Another really cool thing about the
            onModelCreating method is that you can pre-populate your DB with dummy data! No need to have a separate SQL script for seeding data,
            do it all in code using our favorite language, C#. After getting the data there's nothing better than calling FirstOrDefault(), or Select()
            to convert all your data into DTO's, or calling Include() to fetch relational data. Such an exciting combination of .Net tools.
          </p>
          <h2>Dependency Injection (and Moq)</h2>
          <p>
            Unity was great to work with, but now .Net Core comes with dependency injection built-in. The benefits of using DI are obvious if you've
            been developing for any decent amount of time, and I love that the mindset is such that DI should be there from the start of a project. When
            working on a WebAPI, most of your registrations will look like this:
            <p><code>services.AddScoped&lt;ICarpoolDetails, CarpoolDetails&gt;();</code></p>
            So clean and simple, yet very customize and powerful if you need it to be.
          </p>
