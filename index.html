        Languages, coding, food, coffee, and beer in that order are the things I'm most into. Originally from Guatemala and brought to the
        US as a young child, I grew up in Portland, Oregon and pretty much absorbed all the hippy concepts that the culture in Portland has
        become known for. I love languages and currently am able to speak English, Spanish, French, and Japanese fluently. I am also working
        on Korean and SerboCroatian.
