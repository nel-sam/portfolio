      <h2>Bio</h2>
      <article>
        Languages, coding, food, coffee, and beer in that order are the things I'm most into. Originally from Guatemala and brought to the
        US as a young child, I grew up in Portland, Oregon and pretty much absorbed all the hippy concepts that the culture in Portland has
        become known for. I love languages and currently am able to speak English, Spanish, French, and Japanese fluently. I am also working
        on Korean and SerboCroatian, hence the mobile apps you can view below that are for learning these two languages.

      <h3>Navika</h3>
      <img src="./images/navika.png" />
      <article>Navika is my most developed app and it's main goal is to get users familiarized with the difficult grammar points
        of the Serbo-Croation family, which includes Croatian, Serbian, Bosnian, and Montenegrin. Users can practice concepts such as
        declension, verb conjugations, cyrillic, and more.
